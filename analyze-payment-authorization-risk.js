console.log('🚨 CRITICAL ANALYSIS: Square Payment Authorization for Admin-Created Bookings');
console.log('============================================================================');

console.log('\n📋 ISSUE SUMMARY:');
console.log('When bookings are created via Square API (showing as "admin-created"),');
console.log('there may be restrictions on payment processing capabilities.');

console.log('\n🔍 POTENTIAL RESTRICTIONS:');
console.log('==========================');

const restrictions = [
  {
    area: 'No-Show Fee Charging',
    risk: 'HIGH',
    description: 'May not be able to charge customers for no-shows',
    impact: 'Business model failure'
  },
  {
    area: 'Late Cancellation Fees',
    risk: 'HIGH', 
    description: 'May not be able to enforce cancellation policies',
    impact: 'Revenue loss, policy ineffectiveness'
  },
  {
    area: 'Card Authorization Holds',
    risk: 'MEDIUM',
    description: 'May not be able to place holds on customer cards',
    impact: 'No protection against no-shows'
  },
  {
    area: 'Payment Capture',
    risk: 'HIGH',
    description: 'May not be able to actually charge held amounts',
    impact: 'Cannot enforce any fees'
  },
  {
    area: 'Dispute Resolution',
    risk: 'MEDIUM',
    description: 'Weaker position in chargeback disputes',
    impact: 'Higher refund rates'
  }
];

  console.log(`\n${index + 1}. ${restriction.area}`);
  console.log(`   Risk Level: ${restriction.risk}`);
  console.log(`   Issue: ${restriction.description}`);
  console.log(`   Impact: ${restriction.impact}`);
});

console.log('\n💡 WHY THIS HAPPENS:');
console.log('====================');
console.log('• API-created bookings use business credentials');
console.log('• Square sees these as "admin actions" not "customer actions"');
console.log('• Customer consent chain may be considered broken');
console.log('• Payment processing regulations may require direct customer authorization');

console.log('\n🧪 TESTING NEEDED:');
console.log('==================');
console.log('1. Create a real booking via API');
console.log('2. Attempt to place authorization hold on customer card');
console.log('3. Try to capture (charge) the held amount');
console.log('4. Monitor for any error messages about permissions or consent');

console.log('\n📞 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:');

console.log('\n❓ QUESTIONS TO ASK SQUARE:');
console.log('===========================');
const questions = [
  'Are there payment processing restrictions for API-created vs customer-created bookings?',
  'Can admin-created bookings charge no-show fees without additional customer consent?',
  'What consent requirements exist for API-created booking payment captures?',
  'Are there different dispute resolution policies for admin vs customer-created bookings?',
  'Does Square differentiate between direct customer card input vs API tokenization?',
  'Are there compliance requirements that restrict admin-created booking payments?'
];

  console.log(`${index + 1}. ${question}`);

console.log('===============================');
console.log('1. 🔴 URGENT: Contact Square support today');
console.log('2. 🧪 Test payment authorization in sandbox with real API bookings');
console.log('3. 📋 Document all payment processing attempts and errors');
console.log('4. 💼 Prepare enhanced consent workflow as backup plan');
console.log('5. ⚖️  Consult with legal team about payment processing compliance');

console.log('\n🚨 BUSINESS IMPACT ASSESSMENT:');
console.log('==============================');
console.log('If no-show fees cannot be charged for API-created bookings:');
console.log('• 📉 Revenue loss from unpaid no-shows');
console.log('• 📋 Policy enforcement becomes impossible');
console.log('• 🔄 May need to completely redesign booking system');
console.log('• 💰 Significant development cost to switch approaches');
