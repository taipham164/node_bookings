# Existing Customer SMS Verification Implementation

## üìã Overview
Updated the contact page flow so that **both existing and new customers** must verify their phone number via SMS before proceeding to their respective booking forms.

## üîß Changes Made

### 1. Updated Customer Lookup Button
**File**: `views/pages/contact.ejs`

**Before**:
```html
<button type="button" class="submit-btn" onclick="showExistingCustomerStep()">
    <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i> Continue with this account
</button>
```

**After**:
```html
<button type="button" class="submit-btn" onclick="showSMSModalForExistingCustomer()">
    <i class="fas fa-sms"></i> Continue with this account
</button>
```

### 2. Added New SMS Modal Function for Existing Customers
**Function**: `showSMSModalForExistingCustomer()`
- Sends SMS verification to existing customer's phone
- Shows modal with "Verify & Continue" button text
- Sets up verification flow specifically for existing customers

### 3. Updated Modal Verification Handler
**Enhanced**: Modal verification code handler now routes users based on customer status:

```javascript
// Route to appropriate step based on customer status
if (customerExists && customerData) {
    // Existing customer - show existing customer step
    showExistingCustomerStep();
} else {
    // New customer - show new customer step
    showNewCustomerStep();
}
```
