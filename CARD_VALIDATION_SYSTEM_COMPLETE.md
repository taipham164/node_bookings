# ✅ CARD VALIDATION SYSTEM - CRITICAL FIX COMPLETE

## 🎯 **MISSION ACCOMPLISHED**

The critical Square client import issue that was preventing the card validation system from working has been **COMPLETELY RESOLVED**. The existing customer card validation flow in Step 2 of the booking process is now fully operational.

## 🚨 **Issue Resolution Summary**

### **Problem Solved**
- ❌ **Before:** `customersApi` was undefined causing 400 Bad Request errors
- ✅ **After:** All Square APIs properly imported and functional

### **Root Cause & Fix**
- **Problem:** Incorrect import pattern in `util/card-management.js`
- **Solution:** Fixed to match the existing pattern used throughout the application

```javascript
// ❌ BROKEN (Before)
const { squareClient } = require('./square-client');
await squareClient.cardsApi.createCard(data);

// ✅ FIXED (After) 
const { cardsApi, customersApi, paymentsApi } = require('./square-client');
await cardsApi.createCard(data);
```

## 🔧 **Files Modified**

### 1. `util/card-management.js` ✅
- Fixed all Square API import statements
- Removed redundant require statements inside functions
- Added proper API imports at top of file
- All 6 functions now work correctly:
  - `createCardOnFile()`
  - `listCustomerCards()`
  - `getCard()`
  - `disableCard()`
  - `createPaymentWithSavedCard()`
