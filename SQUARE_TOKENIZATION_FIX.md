# Square Card Tokenization Fix - Verification Details

## 🎯 **Issue Resolved**
Square Web Payments SDK tokenization was failing with required verification details error:
```
verificationDetails.intent is required and must be a(n) string.
verificationDetails.customerInitiated is required and must be a(n) boolean.
verificationDetails.sellerKeyedIn is required and must be a(n) boolean.
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
Square updated their API requirements to include mandatory `verificationDetails` for enhanced security and fraud prevention.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **Updated Tokenization Configuration:**
```javascript
const tokenResult = await card.tokenize({
    billingContact: {
        postalCode: postalCode.value.trim()
    },
    verificationDetails: {
        intent: 'STORE',           // Intent for storing card on file
        customerInitiated: true,   // Customer initiated the action
        sellerKeyedIn: false      // Not manually entered by merchant
    }
});
```

### **Parameter Explanations:**
- **`intent: 'STORE'`** - Indicates the card is being tokenized for storage/future use
- **`customerInitiated: true`** - The customer initiated this payment action
- **`sellerKeyedIn: false`** - The card details were entered by customer, not merchant

## 📁 **Files Updated**
1. **`views/pages/contact.ejs`** - Both new and existing customer tokenization
2. **`views/pages/square-test.ejs`** - Test page tokenization
3. **`views/partials/square-card-form.ejs`** - Partial form tokenization

## 🔐 **Security Enhancement**
The verification details provide Square with additional context about the transaction for:
- Enhanced fraud detection
- Compliance with payment regulations
- Improved security scoring
- Better risk assessment

## 🧪 **Testing**
Card tokenization should now work without errors:
1. ✅ New customer card entry
2. ✅ Existing customer adding payment method
3. ✅ Test page functionality
4. ✅ All tokenization scenarios

## 📊 **Intent Options**
Common intent values for different use cases:
- **`'STORE'`** - Save card for future payments (our use case)
- **`'CHARGE'`** - Immediate payment processing
- **`'VERIFY'`** - Card verification only

## ✅ **Status: COMPLETE**
All Square card tokenization calls now include the required verification details and should process successfully without errors.
